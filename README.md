# WAES Technical Assignment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ppedemon/waes-ta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ppedemon/waes-ta) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ppedemon/waes-ta/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/ppedemon/waes-ta?branch=master) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f5ac469ff1ac4f3e8c433807280f8f09)](https://www.codacy.com/app/ppedemon/waes-ta?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=ppedemon/waes-ta&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Overview

The assignment is implemented as a set of asynchronous, stateless HTTP endpoints. I've used
[Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) and [Reactive Java](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), with
a design mirroring a typical Spring solution, in the sense that the code features a
controller, service, and repository layers. For data persistence I'm using MongoDB.

## Features

* CI pipeline running tests, static code reports, and building+pushing Docker image to
    [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/ppedemon/waes-ta).
* 95% test coverage according to Jacoco. Full details available in [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/ppedemon/waes-ta).
* "A" code quality according to [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/project/ppedemon/waes-ta/dashboard?bid=13401365).
* Current implementation hosted in a [Kubernetes cluster](http://184.172.247.245:30800/swagger).
  Check the [waes-ta-devops](https://github.com/ppedemon/waes-ta-devops) project for the full details.
* API secured with bearer JWT authorization. User management and JWT token negotiation
  delegated to [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/).
* Extra endpoints `GET /v1/diff/{id}/status` and `DELETE /v1/diff/{id}`.
* API is fully documented with [Swagger](http://184.172.247.245:30800/swagger).

## Usage

Testing only requires JDK 1.8 installed. Run tests by executing:
```bash
./gradlew test integrationTest
./gradlew jacocoTestReport  # Optional, find report in build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
```

Running locally requires [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for running Mongo and Keycloack,
and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for executing the script negotiating a JWT token. Wait a little bit after
executing `docker-compose`, since Keycloak takes some time to start up. If you run the `dev/mongo-setup.sh` script
(optional!), you'll also need a `mongo` client installed.

```bash
docker-compose -f dev/docker-compose.yaml up -d  # Startup Keycloak and Mongo
source dev/mongo-setup.sh                        # Optional, create indexes in local Mongo database
./gradlew run
```

Once the application is running:
```bash
source dev/token.sh  # Create JWT token, store it in TOKEN env var. Valid for 1 day.
```

Then your are ready to send requests to the server. For example:
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization:Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -d $(echo Left data | base64) http://localhost:8080/v1/diff/1/left
```

Or you can hit the [Swagger docs](http://localhost:8080/swagger). Hit the `Authorize` button on the upper right,
paste the value of the `TOKEN` environment variable, and you're ready to go.

Alternatively, go to the live [Swagger docs](http://184.172.247.245:30800/swagger) in IBM Cloud. Get a JWT token by
cloning [waes-ta-devops](https://github.com/ppedemon/waes-ta-devops), and from that project's root folder execute:
```bash
source util/token.sh 184.172.247.245:30900
echo $TOKEN
```

## Assumptions

* **Payload not restricted to JSON**: the application doesn't assume that the base64 encoded
    data to compare is actually JSON. You can send any kind of data as long as it's base64 encoded.
* **Users provide IDs:** Since the statement requires that endpoints for pushing data to
    compare (`/v1/diff/{id}/left` and `/v1/diff/{id}/right`) get IDs explicitly, I'm assuming
    that the user is responsible for providing them. When users are in control of resource
    IDs, it makes sense to [use the `PUT` method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/630453/put-vs-post-in-rest)
    with upsert semantics for resource creation. This is exactly what I'm doing in my implementation.
* **Base64 Data must be decoded before comparing:** Due to padding two different data blobs can end up
    having base64 encodings with equal length. It would be very unnatural for the Rest API to report
    equal length and a list of differences when the original sides to compare were actually of different
    length. Therefore the compare endpoint decodes base64 data to byte arrays before comparing.
* **Comparison IDs don't have to be globally unique:** It would be too restrictive to ask users to provide
    globally unique comparison IDs. So IDs have to be unique **only** at the user level. Comparisons are
    uniquely identified by a combination of a unique user ID and the user-provided comparison ID. User
    information (including the user ID) is provided to the API by means of the Bearer JWT token.

## Possible Improvements

* Provide endpoint to page through all user's comparisons. This is easy, but I haven't had the time to code it ðŸ˜Ÿ.
* Add a description to both sides of a comparison, so users can get better insights about comparisons when querying.
* Mongo limits document size to 16Mb, so using Mongo won't be suitable for large data chunks. In order to avoid
  running into data size issues, this application limits data size to 5Mb. We could circumvent this limitation
  by using another kind of storage more suited for big data, such as GridFS or HDFS.
